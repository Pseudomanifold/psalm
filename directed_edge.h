*
*	Used for performing a lookup in the edge table of the mesh. Directed
*	edges are necessary because in an oriented 2-manifold mesh, each edge
*	appears twice (at least implicitly). For _working_ with edge data,
*	however, edge (a,b) and (b,a) are essentially the same and need _not_
*	be stored twice. Hence, to avoid any duplicates, an edge attribute
*	tells the caller the orientation of the edge.
